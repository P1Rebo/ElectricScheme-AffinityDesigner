# ElectricScheme-AffinityDesigner
Template of an Electric Scheme as Affinity Designer Layer (Elektroplan-Vorlage).
Since I spend some hours searching for some best fitting icons, maybe somebody has a usage :-)

## Usage
Just import the psd-File into Affinity Designer (or maybe also other Tools, didn't try).
It's optimized for using within an A3 Sheet, e.g. with floor plan as first layer.
